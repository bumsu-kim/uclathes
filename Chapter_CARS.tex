\section{Conclusion Remarks} \label{sec:conclusion}
We proposed three query-efficient and lightweight DFO algorithms: CARS, CARS-CR and CARS-NQ. Our analysis establishes the convergence on strongly convex functions for CARS and convex functions for CARS-CR. Specifically, we develop a novel and rigorous analysis on the finite difference errors and the probability of significant descents of the objective function. CARS can incorporate various distributions, making it highly adaptable to a range of problem-specific distributions. We demonstrate the efficacy of CARS and its variants through benchmark tests, where they outperform existing methods in minimizing non-convex functions as well.
